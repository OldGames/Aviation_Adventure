# Aviation_Adventure
Unpacker for the "Aviation Adventure" File System.


Note: Since the file system contains some duplicate entries for the same directories, the script ignores duplicates by default and will only extract one instance of each directory. Duplicates are logged in the output (see log.txt).
The game searches for files in hardcoded paths which don't always correspond to path selected by the script. See "dir.txt" for the correct folder structure the game expects.
